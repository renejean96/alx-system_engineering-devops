## 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions
in this project that is where we are going to cover how to do the following task:
. create an alias
. list aliases
. temporarily disable an alias
. perform arithmetic operations with the shell

## Task 0
a script that creates an alias is alias ls="rm *"
## Task 1
a script that prints hello user, where user is the current Linux user: ``echo"hello $USER"
## Task 2
Add /action to the PATH. /action should be the last directory the shell looks into when looking for a program.
``PATH=PATH:/action
